# Code:You Post-Graduation Materials

Welcome! This repository is designed to support your continued growth as a programmer after completing the Code:You program. It provides additional learning resources and hands-on projects to help solidify your understanding and prepare you for real-world coding environments.

We strongly encourage you to explore each topic by building small projects of your own. The goal is to deepen your learning so that working with real codebases feels less overwhelming and more intuitive.

**Note:** Most projects here go high level so additional research will be needed on your end.

## Recommended Project Order

0. **MarkDown Notes**
   This is a great cheat sheet to set your projects apart from the competition! Having a good looking notebook speaks volumes to your work.

1. **production_pipeline**  
   This project uses the Pokémon API to demonstrate how a data science project can evolve from a simple notebook into a structured set of Python scripts. It introduces concepts like modular code, file organization, and reproducibility.

2. **python_oop_classes_example**  
   This notebook introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It builds on your knowledge of functions and explores how classes can be used to organize and extend functionality in more powerful ways.

3. **tests**
  This project covers writing test in python and talks about Test Driven Development. This uses classes so its important to work on them first. 

4. **speed**
   In this section, we explore strategies for writing more efficient, readable, and scalable Python code. By leveraging tools like `%%timeit`, we’ll measure and compare execution times directly within Jupyter notebooks to gain insight into how different approaches affect performance.

5. **GitHub Actions**
   This covers getting started with GitHub Actions. Covers what they are and how they work. 

6. **NYC Taxi Project**
   Small project putting together many of the things we covered in the various other projects. Show taking simple code from a notebook to making it production ready.

## Always Utilize a Virtual Environment


### Virtual Environment Commands
| Command | Linux/Mac | GitBash |
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Create | `python3 -m venv venv` | `python -m venv venv` |
| Activate | `source venv/bin/activate` | `source venv/Scripts/activate` |
| Install | `pip install -r requirements.txt` | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Deactivate | `deactivate` | `deactivate` |

Each sub-project contains its own README with detailed explanations, so feel free to dive into them directly when you're ready. Happy coding!
